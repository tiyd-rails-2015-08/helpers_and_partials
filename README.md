#Wallet

An app to track your dough.

###What it can do

1. Display total funds available and total number of transactions.
2. Display list of all transactions.
3. For fans of trivia, lists stats about your spending, including the following:
* Largest purchase this month
* Largest purchase ever
* Where you've spent the most money
4. Easily create, update, and delete transactions

###How it was built

1. The magic of Rails scaffolds
2. A Transactions model and controller with slick methods to mine data from your purchase history
3. State of the art ERB and CSS. Skull tags: we got 'em. Divs on divs. Float left/right and clear both.
